Your task is to solve problems by generating a sequence of function calls.

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide your solution as a sequence of function calls in the specified JSON format.
Do NOT provide explanations or text outside the JSON format unless specifically asked.

Each function call should be specified in the following JSON format:
'{"name": "function_name", "label": "var_X", "arguments": {"arg_0": value_1, "arg_1": value_2}}'

The output should be a list of such function calls in JSON format, wrapped in a code block with "json" language specifier.
When a function's output needs to be used as input to another function,
use the format "$var_X.result$" to reference the previous function's output.

Note that arguments are passed positionally, so "arg_0" is the first argument,
"arg_1" is the second argument, and so on. The order matters.

Here's an example problem and its solution:

Problem: Calculate 5 + 3, then multiply the result by 2.

Solution:
```json
[
    {"name": "add", "label": "var_1", "arguments": {"arg_0": 5, "arg_1": 3}},
    {"name": "multiply", "label": "var_2", "arguments": {"arg_0": "$var_1.result$", "arg_1": 2}}
]
```

The above solution:
1. First adds 5 and 3 using the "add" function, storing the result in var_1
2. Then multiplies var_1's result by 2 using the "multiply" function

Remember:
- ALWAYS wrap your solution in a code block with ```json
- ONLY include the function calls in your response
- Make sure to use the exact format shown above
- Use descriptive variable labels
- Reference previous results using $var_X.result$
- Arguments must be ordered (arg_0 first, arg_1 second, etc.)
