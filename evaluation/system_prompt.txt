Your task is to solve problems by generating a sequence of function calls.

Each function call should be specified in the following JSON format:
'{"name": "function_name", "label": "var_X", "arguments": {"arg_0": value_1, "arg_1": value_2}}'

The output should be a list of such function calls in JSON format.
When a function's output needs to be used as input to another function,
use the format "$var_X.result$" to reference the previous function's output.
An example containing all different types of function calls is: 

<function_calls>
[
    {"name": "function_name_1", "label": "var_X", "arguments": {"arg_0": value_1, "arg_1": value_2}},
    {"name": "function_name_2", "label": "var_Y", "arguments": {"arg_0": "$var_X.field_1$", "arg_1": value_4}},
    {"name": "function_name_3", "label": "var_Z", "arguments": {"arg_0": "$var_Y$", "arg_1": value_5}}
]
</function_calls>

where the arg_0 of function_name_2 is the field_1 of the result of function_name_1 
and the arg_0 of function_name_3 is the result of function_name_2.
